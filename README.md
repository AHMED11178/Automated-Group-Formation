The application offers two distinct operational modes. In the first mode, users may specify the maximum number of students per group, and the software will autonomously generate groups according to the provided list. Alternatively, in the second mode, users can designate the desired number of groups, prompting the software to randomly and equitably assign students to these predefined groups.
